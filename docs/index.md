# Abstract

The Lottie Blueprint Format is not intended to validate that a lottie json file is a valid Lottie animation. Its purpose is to work as a template validator for lottie animations. As an example, it will validate that there are two shape layers in the animation, or whether assets are no larger than a certain width / height.
